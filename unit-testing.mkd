Executable things that compile despite errors

## Questions

### how big is too big for a unit test?

Unit tests give you...

- spec
  - Here's a test: can you write the scenario on a whiteboard? If you can't,
    then coding it will be a problem.
- feedback :)
- regression ("now that it's working, does it still work?")
- granularity ("when regression no longer works, why?")
  - temporal granularity: "what's did you type since it passed?"
